# simple-html-layout-with-css

Creating a html page to practice learning with basic html and css
 
Started off by using default html5 template.

Then I created individual sections for header, nav, and the footer.

I included the section, article, (h1, h2, h3), and p in its own section to create parent and child containers.
    -I had issues here because the when the entire section was called, the flex command send the child containers all the way left. 
        -I combatted this by changing margins and playing with numbers to center the containers
I used flex commands to place the "section" container alongside the "aside" container

I used the same css attributes for header, footer, and nav which is why I called the three tags simultaneously and entered the attributes only once for the 3.
    -I did the same for my "h1, h2, h3" and "p" containers.

One Issue I realized after creating the web page is that the content inside of my "section" container does not adjust with shrinking the web browser. 

Some of the resources that helped me are as followed
    -Flexzombies helped me line up content next to each other
    -Youtube video "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCoQOS4s5ls" was also resourceful in realizing how parent and child containers react with one another.
